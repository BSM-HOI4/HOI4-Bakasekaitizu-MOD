# Event
chile.1.t: "Territorial Negotiations by Chile"
chile.1.d: "Chile has set its national policy on becoming a more elongated country, driven by territorial ambitions. As a starting point, they have initiated negotiations for territorial cession with our country located directly above them. Refusing could easily lead to war, a scenario that is not hard to imagine. However, their opponent has rapidly expanded their industrial power in recent years, and there is no guarantee of victory in a conflict. It might be wise to consider peaceful resolutions."

They have approached us with a negotiation, acknowledging our rapidly developing industrial power, and proposing compensation in exchange for territory. Additionally, they have asked for protection from external aggression until their inland territories are developed."
chile.4.a: "If it can be settled with money, I'll pay as much as needed"
chile.5.t: "Threat of Coastal Empire's Invasion"
chile.5.d: "Chile, identifying itself as a Coastal Empire, is aiming to invade coastal regions worldwide. They have set their sights on our South American nation due to our comparable strength. It is crucial to unite and resist the threat posed by Chile. "
chile.5.a: "Unite!"
chile.5.b: "No need for alliances among weaker nations!"
